# IETF 122 side meeting, 2025-03-19

## Official meeting minutes

### Meeting summary

The meeting was convened to discuss the possible chartering of a new Research Group (SPACE RG) under the IRTF, focused on space networking topics, including interoperability, capacity constraints, and the future of research in satellite and non-terrestrial networks.

**Key Discussion Points:**

1. Charter Scope Debate:

  * Wes Eddy and Dirk emphasized a flexible, evolving scope with a possible living charter.
  * Juan noted a divergence between participants favoring a broad exploratory scope and those preferring a sharply defined one. This needs resolution in the charter draft.

2. Relevance and Uniqueness:

  * Nitinder Mohan highlighted the need to distinguish SPACE RG from existing groups like MAPRG, LEONET, and LEOCONN.
  * Emphasis on attracting operator interest through concrete topics like spectrum sharing.

3. On Measurement and Starlink Focus:

  * Dan York and Felix cautioned against over-focusing on Starlink; this may lead to reverse-engineering rather than productive research.
  * Juan suggested instead focusing on producing attractive research outputs that may incentivize proprietary constellation operators to participate.

4. Capacity and Technical Challenges:

  * Ulrich Speidel and Mike Puchol discussed satellite capacity limitations, bufferbloat, and shifting performance priorities (e.g., data rates over latency).
  * Recognition of emerging deployment architectures and constraints of deep space communication.

5. Interoperability as a Core Theme:

  * Nishanth and Felix strongly endorsed interoperability as a research priority, avoiding a single-vendor bias.

6. Industry and Global Participation:

  * Dirk stressed the importance of engaging contributors actively working on relevant technologies, including potential partners from Chinese initiatives and global space efforts.

### Action items and next steps

1. Charter Revision:
  * Reconcile diverging views on scope (broad vs. defined). Update the SPACE RG charter accordingly.

2. Engagement Strategy with Industry:
  * Develop a strategy to attract proprietary constellation stakeholders (e.g., Starlink) via compelling, inclusive research topics.

3. Planning for IETF 123 (Madrid):
  * Begin compiling a list of on-site speakers. Juan will follow up with contacts from the i2Cat Space Communications group for participation.
